# Clipper 2d
 
This repository is a reimplementation of the Clipper2 library, rewritten to better suit the needs of my game development project.
The goal is to enhance portability, improve performance, and provide clear documentation. This version focuses on making the library
easier to link, more efficient, and simpler to understand for those who want to integrate it into their projects.

If you want to know why and how I am going to reimplement it see [this]() blog post on my website
